Is seed[seedStart] in target ?
    No -> Increment Seedstart, looking for new sequence, start on new foundSequence - goto A
    Yes -> seedSequencePoint = sequenceStart+1 - add sequencePoint to found list - first in new foundSequence


        Is seed[seedSequencePoint] in target ?
        Yes -> Increment seedSequencePoint - add sequencePoint to foundSequence
        No -> If seedSequencePoint is last in seed: increment Seedstart, SeedSequencePoint=0,
                    looking for new sequence, start on new foundSequence
                    if (foundSequence > longestFound) longestFound = foundSequence
